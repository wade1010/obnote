### 学习目标

- 了解NLP中GLUE标准数据集合的相关知识.

- 掌握GLUE标准数据集合的下载方式, 数据样式及其对应的任务类型.

- GLUE数据集合的介绍:

	- GLUE由纽约大学, 华盛顿大学, Google联合推出, 涵盖不同NLP任务类型, 截止至2020年1月其中包括11个子任务数据集, 成为衡量NLP研究发展的衡量标准.

### GLUE数据集合包含以下数据集

- CoLA 数据集

- SST-2 数据集

- MRPC 数据集

- STS-B 数据集

- QQP 数据集

- MNLI 数据集

- SNLI 数据集

- QNLI 数据集

- RTE 数据集

- WNLI 数据集

- diagnostics数据集(官方未完善)

- GLUE数据集合的下载方式:
