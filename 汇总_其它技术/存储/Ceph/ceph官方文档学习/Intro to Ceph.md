## PLATFORMS

The charts below show how Ceph’s requirements map onto various Linux platforms. Generally speaking, there is very little dependence on specific distributions outside of the kernel and system initialization package (i.e., sysvinit, systemd).

| Release Name | Tag | CentOS | Ubuntu | OpenSUSE  | Debian  | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Quincy | 17.2.z | 8  | 20.04  | 15.3 | 11 | 
| Pacific | 16.2.z | 8  | 18.04  | 15.2 | 10, 11 | 
| Octopus | 15.2.z | 7  | 18.04  | 15.2 | 10 | 


- A

: Ceph provides packages and has done comprehensive tests on the software in them.

- B

: Ceph provides packages and has done basic tests on the software in them.

- C

Note

**For Centos 7 Users**

Btrfs is no longer tested on Centos 7 in the Octopus release. We recommend using bluestore instead.
